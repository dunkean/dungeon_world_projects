        <p>Deep within the heart of the mountain, a small group of resilient dwarf miners toils tirelessly in the depths of the earth. Their home, Shadowvein hall is a testament to their unwavering dedication to their craft. Carved from the living rock, the hall is adorned with shimmering crystals and veins of precious ore, casting a warm, golden glow. The rhythmic sound of pickaxes echoes through the tunnels as the miners unearth rich veins of silver, gold, and gemstones. In the flickering light of the forges, skilled artisans shape the raw materials into intricate works of art, crafting exquisite jewelry and ornate weapons. Despite the dangers that lurk within the dark tunnels, these stout-hearted dwarves stand united, their camaraderie and resilience forming the bedrock of their enduring legacy.</p>

                <h3>anecdotes</h3>
                <p>Legend has it that the ancient settlers who founded Luminia were deeply connected to the spirits of the forest. They were said to be able to communicate with the creatures of the woods and even control them. According to local beliefs, these settlers were able to tame even the most fearsome beasts of the forest, including the deadly dire wolves that still roam the mountains around Luminia. Some tales even say that the settlers made a pact with the spirits of the wood, promising to protect and tend to the forest in exchange for their help. Today, the people of Luminia still call upon the spirits of the forest for guidance, offering offerings and prayers to ensure their continued protection., The ruins in the ancient forest surrounding Luminia are shrouded in mystery and fear. Local beliefs hold that they are cursed, and that those who enter them rarely return. The villagers of Luminia tell cautionary tales of adventurers who entered the ruins seeking treasure, only to be driven mad or devoured by the spirits that dwell within. Some of the elders claim that the ruins were once a temple dedicated to a non-gendered God, worshipped by the ancient empire that ruled the unique continent long before Luminia was founded. Others whisper of a forgotten event that took place in the ruins, an event so terrible that it caused the spirits of the wood to turn against the empire and destroy it utterly. Whether these tales are true or not, the ruins remain a place of great danger and mystery., The people of Luminia have always been aware that they share their village with more than just their fellow humans. Legends of ghosts and other supernatural beings have circulated in the village for centuries, with each generation adding its own twists and embellishments to the tales. One of the most persistent of these stories is that of the ghostly figure that wanders the streets of Luminia at night. Some say that it is the spirit of a long-dead adventurer, still searching for treasure in the village he loved. Others claim that it is the restless soul of a villager who was wronged and seeks revenge. Whatever the truth of the matter, the villagers take care to avoid the places where the ghostly figure has been seen, lest they meet an untimely end., There are few creatures more fearsome than the dragon, a massive reptilian beast capable of breathing fire and tearing apart entire armies with ease. So when a traveler claimed to have seen a dragon sleeping in the mountains near Luminia, many dismissed it as nothing more than a tall tale. But there were those in the village who believed the traveler's account, and who secretly hoped that the dragon would remain asleep and not come down to lay waste to their homes. For years after the sighting, villagers whispered about the dragon and speculated about its origins and intentions. Some even went so far as to venture into the mountains seeking the dragon, but none returned to tell their tales., The forest that surrounds Luminia is a place of great beauty and great danger. It is a place where travelers can easily become lost, wandering for days without any sign of civilization. So when a young girl was lost in the forest for three days and returned unharmed, claiming to have been guided by a talking rabbit, the villagers were both amazed and frightened. The girl's tale spread quickly throughout the village, with some believing that she had truly encountered a magical creature that had helped her find her way home. Others dismissed it as the fevered imaginings of a child lost in the woods. But regardless of the truth of the matter, the tale of the talking rabbit has become one of the most enduring legends of Luminia., Sometimes, strangers arrive in Luminia with mysterious abilities and powers that seem almost magical. One such stranger arrived in the village one day and cured a woman of a terminal illness with a single touch. The villagers were both awed and frightened by this act, unsure of whether the stranger was a gift from the spirits of the forest or an agent of darker forces. But regardless of their fears, the stranger was welcomed into the village and treated with great respect and hospitality. The villagers hoped that the stranger would remain in Luminia, that they might learn from their wisdom and perhaps even be blessed with more miracles.</p>

                <h3>architecture</h3>
                <p>The ancient ruins in the forest are a source of both fascination and fear for the villagers of Luminia. Once home to an unknown civilization, the ruins remain shrouded in mystery. Scholars believe that they hold the key to understanding the forgotten event that changed the course of the village's history. Locals, on the other hand, tell stories of curses and malevolent spirits that haunt the ruins. Despite the dangers, some adventurous souls still venture into the ruins in the hopes of uncovering their secrets. The ruins are guarded by the spirits of the forest, who will guide those they deem worthy and punish those who disrespect the ancient site. It is said that the ruins emit a strange light at night, leading some to speculate that they are still imbued with magic from a time long past., The temple of the Old One is a place of great reverence for the people of Luminia. The non-gendered God is believed to have created the unique continent upon which the village stands, as well as the ancient forest that surrounds it. The temple itself is a humble structure located on the outskirts of the village, with a single spire reaching towards the sky. It is tended to by a group of devoted scholars and priests, who offer prayers to the Old One at dawn and dusk each day. The temple is also a center for intellectual pursuits, with scholars from all over the continent coming to study the ancient texts housed within its walls. Despite its importance, the temple remains accessible to all who seek solace and guidance from the God of Luminia., The defensive wall surrounding the village has stood for decades, protecting the people of Luminia from threats both human and beastly. Built after an attack by wolves that left several villagers injured, the wall is made from a combination of stone and timber. Guard towers are stationed along its perimeter, each manned by a group of skilled archers. The wall has been put to the test on several occasions, including a bandit invasion three decades ago and sporadic raids by goblin bands from the mountains. Despite these challenges, the wall has never been breached, a testament to the resilience and determination of the people of Luminia., The marketplace in the town square is a hub of activity and commerce in Luminia. Traders from neighboring villages bring their wares to sell, including timber, honey, herbs, fish, wool, pottery, and cheese. Local merchants also set up shop in the square, selling everything from handcrafted jewelry to freshly baked bread. The market is held every other week, and is known for its lively atmosphere and sense of community. It is also a place where rumors and news are exchanged, making it an important source of information for those seeking to learn about external influences on the village., The inn known for its famous honey mead is a popular destination for travelers passing through Luminia. Located at the edge of the village, it offers comfortable rooms and hearty meals to weary adventurers. Its signature drink, honey mead, is brewed on site using honey from the village's apiaries. The innkeeper is a friendly and welcoming host, eager to share stories and advice with his guests. The inn is also a center for information about the surrounding area, with maps and guides available to those seeking to explore the ancient forest or venture into the mountains beyond., The mill along the river that provides flour to the village is a vital resource for the people of Luminia. Powered by the swift currents of the river, the mill produces enough flour to feed the entire village. Its machinery is maintained by a team of skilled craftsmen who take great pride in their work. The mill is also a place of community, with villagers coming together to share news and gossip while waiting for their grain to be processed. Despite its importance, the mill is still vulnerable to the occasional flood or drought, making the villagers ever mindful of the need to maintain their delicate balance with the forces of nature.</p>

                <p>Luminia has established regular trade with a neighboring village to bolster its resources and promote economic growth. The trade routes are well-traveled and merchants from both villages have built strong relationships over the years. In addition, wandering merchants frequently visit Luminia and bring exotic goods not available in the village. These merchants provide valuable information about the outside world and often share interesting stories from their travels.

These goblins are highly organized and coordinated, and their raids can be devastating to the village's economy and sense of security.

                <h3>history</h3>
                <p>Luminia was founded centuries ago by a group of scholars and adventurers who were drawn to the unique qualities of the ancient forest, river, and mountains that surrounded the area. These pioneers brought with them a desire for knowledge and exploration, as well as a sense of curiosity about the mysteries that lay hidden in the land., Despite facing numerous natural disasters throughout its history, Luminia has always remained a prosperous and protected village. Severe floods have caused widespread damage to the village on three occasions in the past century, but the resilience of the people and their commitment to rebuilding has ensured that the village remains standing and thriving. A great drought led to a famine that lasted for two years, but the villagers pulled together and managed to survive through the difficult times., In more recent history, Luminia faced a bandit invasion that threatened to destroy the hard-won prosperity of the village. However, the brave defenders of Luminia stood firm and repelled the attackers, sending a clear message that the village would not be bullied or threatened. This event strengthened the resolve of the people to continue working towards maintaining the peace and security of the village., One of the most significant events in the history of Luminia was the discovery of a hidden chamber in the ancient ruins in the forest. This chamber contained ancient texts that shed light on the origins of the unique continent on which Luminia is located. The scholars and intellectuals of Luminia pored over these texts, deepening their understanding of the empire that once ruled the continent and the local beliefs and traditions that still hold sway among the people., Following an attack by wolves that threatened the safety of the village, the people of Luminia banded together to build a defensive wall around the perimeter of the village. This wall has served to protect the village from further attacks and has become a symbol of the resilience and determination of the people of Luminia to protect what is theirs., To celebrate the bountiful harvest that was crucial to the survival of the village, Luminia established an annual festival of lights. The festival is a time of great joy and celebration, filled with feasting, dancing, and music. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of community and hospitality, as the people of Luminia open their homes and tables to all who come to participate in the festivities.</p>

                <h3>resources</h3>
                <p>Luminia is located in an ancient forest, and as such, its most abundant resource is timber. The villagers have been careful to manage the forest sustainably, taking only what they need and replanting trees to ensure the forest remains healthy for generations to come. The village’s proximity to the river also allows for easy transport of the timber downstream to other villages and towns. The local carpenters use the timber to create sturdy houses, furniture, and even some of the defensive structures found around the village., The forests around Luminia are also home to many bees, which produce delicious honey. Beekeeping is a common practice in the village, with many families keeping their own hives. The honey is used in cooking, brewing mead, and even as a soothing balm for wounds. In addition to its culinary uses, the honey is also an important trade item, sought after by neighboring villages and traveling merchants., The mountains surrounding Luminia are rich in herbs, which are collected by skilled gatherers and used for medicinal purposes by the village’s healers. Some of the more exotic herbs are also traded with other villages and towns, providing an important source of income for the village. The herbs are also used in cooking, adding unique flavors and aromas to the food., The river that runs through Luminia is teeming with fish, which are caught by the villagers using nets and lines. The fish provide an important source of protein for the villagers, and are also traded with neighboring villages and towns. Some of the more skilled fishermen even supply fish to the traveling merchants who pass through the village., Iron ore is found in abundance in the mountains near Luminia. The villagers mine the ore and smelt it into iron bars, which are then used to create weapons, tools, and other metal objects. The skilled blacksmiths in the village are highly respected, and their wares are in high demand both locally and beyond., Sheep farming is a common practice in the hills around Luminia, providing the villagers with wool for clothing and textiles. The wool is spun into thread and yarn, which is then woven into cloth and made into warm garments. In addition to its practical uses, wool is also an important trade item, exchanged for other goods with neighboring villages and towns., The clay found along the banks of the river is used to create pottery in Luminia. The potters in the village create sturdy vessels for storing food and water, as well as decorative items such as vases and figurines. The pottery is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal, and is traded with other villages and towns., The lush pastures around Luminia are ideal for grazing cows and goats, which provide the villagers with milk and cheese. The cheese is a sought-after delicacy, prized for its rich flavor and creamy texture. The villagers also trade their cheese with other villages and towns, providing an important source of income.</p>

                <h3>timeline</h3>
                <p>Luminia has faced its share of challenges over the past century, with severe floods causing widespread damage to the village three times. The first time it happened, the villagers were caught off guard and struggled to cope with the ramifications. The second time, they had a plan in place, but it was still a difficult and trying experience. By the third flood, the village had implemented long-term preventative measures, such as building higher banks around the river, and the impact was mitigated. Today, Luminia is well-prepared for such occurrences, but the memory of those catastrophic events still lingers., A great drought visited Luminia, leading to a famine that lasted for two years. The villagers were forced to ration their resources carefully, and many people went hungry. Tensions ran high, and there were a few instances where people resorted to stealing from one another. Despite the difficult circumstances, the villagers banded together, sharing what little they had and supporting each other through the trying times. Eventually, the rains returned, and the crops began to grow again. The village learned valuable lessons about sustainability and resilience from this experience., The massive oak tree in the center of the village was a beloved landmark, with a rich history dating back hundreds of years. But one day, it was struck by lightning, and the resulting fire burned it down. The villagers mourned the loss of the tree and worked together to clear away the debris. They planted a new sapling in its place to honor the memory of the old oak. Although the new tree is not as impressive as its predecessor, it represents hope and renewal for the community., The ruins in the forest have always held a certain mystery and intrigue for the people of Luminia. One year, the ruins emitted a strange light for several nights in a row, attracting curious travelers from far and wide. The villagers were fascinated by the phenomenon, and some even claimed to have seen ghostly apparitions. Scholars from nearby cities came to investigate, but they could not find any logical explanation for the strange light. Eventually, it faded away, leaving the villagers with a newfound appreciation for the mysteries of their land., A strange sickness swept through the village, causing people to speak in tongues and see hallucinations. It was a frightening time for everyone, and there were rumors that it was caused by a curse or evil magic. The village healer worked tirelessly to treat those who were affected, but there was no clear cure for the sickness. Eventually, it dissipated as mysteriously as it had arrived. To this day, no one knows what caused the sickness, but the villagers remain wary of anything that seems out of the ordinary., A group of adventurers passing through the village discovered a hidden underground tunnel near the river. It was a serendipitous find, and the villagers were grateful for the discovery. The tunnel provided an additional source of water and a means of escape in the event of an attack. However, there were also concerns about the safety of the tunnel, and it required significant repairs and upkeep to ensure that it remained viable. Over time, the villagers grew more accustomed to its presence and began using it as a means of transport between different parts of the village.</p>

				<h3>Ancestral Sanctuary</h3>
				<p><b>Type:</b> Cooperative</p>
				<p><b>Field:</b> Religion</p>
				<p><b>Activity:</b> Spirituality</p>
				<p><b>Description:</b> The Ancestral Sanctuary is a group of dedicated individuals who have devoted their lives to the study of spirituality and the divinity of the non-gendered God. They believe in the power of faith and ancestry, which they see as key components to maintaining balance with nature. Their main focus is the veneration of their ancestors through regular offerings and prayers at their shrine. The members of the group are highly respected by the people of Luminia, who often seek their guidance and blessings in times of need.</p>

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> Poor</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Ancestral Sanctuary is highly regarded by the people of Luminia. They provide spiritual guidance and comfort to those who seek it. The group maintains friendly relations with the nearby tribe of forest-dwelling elves and often exchanges knowledge about the natural world. They have occasional conflicts with a nearby kingdom over border disputes but have managed to resolve them peacefully so far. The Sanctuary also faces sporadic raids by goblin bands from the mountains but are aided by wandering druids who pass through Luminia from time to time.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> Founded centuries ago by a group of scholars and adventurers who were fascinated by the unique continent they had discovered, the Ancestral Sanctuary has become an integral part of Luminia's culture and history. Over time, the group has survived several natural disasters and repelled a bandit invasion three decades ago. They discovered a hidden chamber in the ruins containing ancient texts, which they have preserved to this day. The group grew in numbers and influence, establishing its own temple on the outskirts of the village.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Legend has it that the founder of the Ancestral Sanctuary, a famous adventurer, brought back a strange plant from his travels. It turned out to be a powerful medicinal herb that has since become an important part of the group's healing practices.. During a particularly harsh winter, when food was scarce, the members of the Ancestral Sanctuary distributed their own supplies among the villagers and refused to accept any compensation for it. It is said that this act of generosity earned them the respect and gratitude of the entire village.. The Ancestral Sanctuary once hosted a visiting scholar who claimed to have discovered a lost scripture that could reveal the true nature of the non-gendered God. The group listened intently and engaged in spirited debates about its authenticity before ultimately deciding that it was a forgery.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> A mysterious illness has befallen the village, and the members of the Ancestral Sanctuary are the only ones who can find a cure. They must undertake a perilous journey into the mountains to collect rare herbs and interact with the spirits of the forest.. A neighboring kingdom has accused the Ancestral Sanctuary of harboring rebels and has sent a delegation to investigate. The group must prove their innocence and defend their right to practice their beliefs.. One of the members of the group has uncovered a shocking secret about the forgotten event that could change everything they know about their own history. They must navigate political intrigue and betrayal as they try to uncover the truth.. The annual festival of lights is coming up, but there is a sense of unease among the members of the Ancestral Sanctuary. They have received a vision that something terrible will happen during the celebrations, and they must try to prevent it using their spiritual powers.</p>

				<p><b>Description:</b> The Blackwood family has been a part of Luminia for generations, but the latest heir, Delaney, has turned to a life of thievery. She believes she has a calling from the Old One to use her skills for a greater good. Along with her fellow thieves, Mara, Nuila, and Ashlan, she runs a highly organized underground syndicate that specializes in stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

				<p><b>History:</b> The Blackwood family has a long history of scholarly pursuits and intellectual endeavors, but Delaney was always more interested in the practical application of knowledge. After several encounters with corrupt officials and greedy nobles, she decided to turn her talents to thievery as a way to right the wrongs of society.

				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Delaney once successfully stole a priceless artifact from a museum in a nearby city that had been thought to be impossible to steal.

Ashlan once distracted an entire group of guards with her chatter while the others made off with the loot.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The group discovers a plot by a wealthy noble to stage a coup and take over the village. They must decide whether to intervene or let things play out.. The authorities finally catch up to them and offer them a chance to turn informant in exchange for reduced sentences..

				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Council of Wisdom discovers an illegal smuggling operation within the village and must navigate a web of deceit and corruption to bring the perpetrators to justice. Meanwhile, tensions mount as nearby kingdoms eye Luminia's resources with envy, and goblin raids increase in frequency and ferocity. Will the council be able to navigate these challenges and ensure the safety and prosperity of the villagers?</p>

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Deepmine Guild has a strong relationship with the people of Luminia who depend on them for the valuable resources they extract from the earth. The villagers often trade goods and services with the guild members and there is a deep respect between the two groups.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Deepmine Guild was first formed over two centuries ago by a group of hardy dwarven miners who sought to make a living from the rich veins of ore that lay hidden beneath the earth's surface. Over time, the guild has grown in size and reputation and has become one of the most well-respected mining groups in the entire region.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Legend has it that one of the founding members of the Deepmine Guild, a dwarf named Balin, once fought off an entire pack of wolves single-handedly to protect a shipment of ore. The guild still honors his memory to this day. Another member, a gregarious dwarf named Gimli, is known for his love of song and his ability to lift the spirits of his fellow miners during long days spent underground. Lastly, an eccentric dwarven inventor named Hrothgar once built a machine that could dig tunnels twice as fast as any pickaxe-wielding miner, but it ultimately proved to be too unstable and was abandoned.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Deepmine Guild has discovered a valuable new vein of ore, but a rival mining group seeks to claim it for themselves. The players are hired to protect the guild's interests and ensure that the rival group is kept at bay.. One of the members of the guild has gone missing while on a scouting mission deep in the tunnels beneath Luminia. The players are hired to find them and bring them back safely.. A series of strange accidents have been occurring within the guild's mines. The players are hired to investigate and discover the cause before it's too late.</p>

				<p><b>History:</b> The Defenders of Luminia were founded shortly after the village was attacked by wolves.

				<p><b>History:</b> The Hardwick family has been operating the mill for generations, with each member learning from the one before them.

Another rumor that circulates around Luminia is that Vinter Helstrom's honey mead is actually enchanted, and that anyone who drinks it will have good luck for the rest of the year. Of course, this is just a tall tale - but it hasn't stopped people from lining up at the inn for a taste!</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> A group of thieves plots to steal the Helstrom family's secret honey mead recipe. A wealthy traveler offers to buy the inn from the Helstroms, but their motives are unclear.

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Hides and Tans Fellowship enjoys a close relationship with the people of Luminia, providing them with high-quality leather goods and supporting the village's prosperity through trade. The guild also works closely with other artisans in the community, exchanging ideas and techniques to improve the quality of their products.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Hides and Tans Fellowship was founded over a century ago by a group of skilled tanners who wanted to share their knowledge and expertise with others. Over time, the guild has grown in size and reputation, becoming an important part of Luminia's economy and culture.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Jenett Darkmantle once saved the guild from financial ruin by introducing a new technique for tanning hides that greatly improved the quality of their leather. Devlin Fenwick is known for her incredible memory and ability to recall the tanning process for any type of hide from memory alone. Despite their differences in personality, the two work together seamlessly to lead the guild.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Hides and Tans Fellowship is struggling to keep up with demand from merchants and needs to find a new source of tannins to stay afloat.. A rival tanner's guild from a neighboring village is undercutting the Hides and Tans Fellowship by selling low-quality leather goods at a lower price.. A mysterious illness is spreading among the animals in the forest, making it difficult for the guild to obtain high-quality hides for their tanning process.</p>

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Honey Keepers maintain a close relationship with the rest of the village, often trading honey and beeswax for other resources they need. They are also active members of the annual festival of lights, where they showcase their latest products and offer samples to visitors. Additionally, they are on good terms with the nearby tribe of forest-dwelling elves, who often seek out their honey for its medicinal properties.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Honey Keepers were founded over a century ago by Gum's great-grandfather, who discovered a natural abundance of wildflowers in the area and saw an opportunity to start producing honey. Over the years, the family has faced numerous challenges, including a severe drought in the early 1900s and an outbreak of disease among the bees in the 1950s. However, they have persevered and remained a staple of the Luminia community.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Once, while gathering honey from a particularly aggressive hive, Morna Denby was stung on the hand and her entire hand swelled up to twice its size. The family had to perform an emergency ritual to help ease the pain and swelling. Another time, a group of travelers passing through Luminia stopped by the Honey Keepers' apiary and were so enamored with their products that they offered to trade a rare artifact for a single jar of honey. Lastly, during the annual honey festival, Renny Skarholt was approached by a young girl who was lost in the woods. Renny used her knowledge of the forest and her connection with the local spirits to safely guide the girl back to her family.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> A neighboring village is experiencing a severe drought and seeks out the Honey Keepers for assistance in starting their own apiary. A new invasive species of beetle threatens to destroy the Honey Keepers' hives. One member of the Honey Keepers discovers a rare and valuable species of flower that could greatly increase honey production, but it only grows in an extremely dangerous part of the forest</p>

				<p><b>Description:</b> The Norwick family has been living and working in Luminia for generations. As one of the few families that farms the land around the village, they are respected for their hard work and dedication. The Blackstone Farmstead, where the family lives and works, is a modest but well-kept plot of land with a small farmhouse and several fields.</p>

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> Poor</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Norwick family is an integral part of the community in Luminia. They provide the village with much of its food, and are respected for their hard work and dedication. The family has friendly relations with most of their neighbors, and often lend a helping hand when needed. However, they have had occasional conflicts with nearby kingdoms over border disputes.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Norwick family has been farming the land around Luminia for generations. The Blackstone Farmstead has weathered many storms and natural disasters over the years, but the family has always managed to keep the farm running. They were hit hard by a severe drought a few years ago, but managed to bounce back with the help of their neighbors.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> 1. Nally Norwick, the wise woman of the family, is known throughout the village for her healing remedies made from local herbs. 2. Devlin Norwick once caught a giant fish in the river that feeds Luminia, and donated it to the annual festival of lights feast. 3. Kiltey Norwick's famous blueberry pie won first prize at the autumn fair.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Norwick family is struggling to keep their farm running after a particularly bad harvest. They are on the brink of bankruptcy and desperately need outside help. The players could be hired by a wealthy merchant or noble to help them, or they could try to rally the village to save the farmstead. Alternatively, the players could discover a new crop or farming technique that could revolutionize the way the family farms, and help them achieve sustainability and prosperity.</p>

They have sporadic raids by goblin bands from the mountains but receive occasional assistance from wandering druids.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> Founded by scholars and adventurers centuries ago, the Raelthorne Trading Company started as a small trading outpost on the outskirts of Luminia.

				<p><b>Description:</b> The Bison Runners are a group of skilled hunters and trappers who venture deep into the wilderness outside of Luminia to hunt bison for their meat, hides, and pelts.

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> Poor</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> Despite being somewhat isolated from the rest of Luminia, the Bison Runners are an integral part of the village's economic and social fabric. They provide much-needed resources such as meat and pelts, and they also serve as a source of pride for the village. The villagers often look up to them as fearless adventurers who are unafraid to take risks to ensure the prosperity of the village.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Bison Runners have been operating for several generations, and their skills have been passed down from father to son (and occasionally, daughter). Over the years, they have faced their fair share of challenges, including harsh winters, dangerous predators, and disputes with neighboring tribes. However, they have persevered thanks to their resilience and strong bond as a community.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Once, the Bison Runners came across a pack of wolves that had brought down a young bison. Instead of simply driving the wolves away, they hunted and killed the wolves, then used their pelts to make warm clothing for themselves.. One winter, the Bison Runners were nearly wiped out by a sudden blizzard that lasted for several days. However, they managed to survive by huddling together in a makeshift shelter, sharing their resources, and using their skills to hunt game even in the harsh conditions.. During a dispute with a neighboring tribe over hunting rights, the Bison Runners managed to negotiate a peaceful resolution by offering to share their bounty with the other tribe.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Bison Runners discover a hidden cave system while on a hunt, and uncover a long-forgotten treasure that could change the fortunes of Luminia forever.. A mysterious illness spreads through the Bison Runners' community, threatening to wipe them out unless a cure can be found.. The Bison Runners are hired by a nearby kingdom to hunt down an elusive monster that has been terrorizing their villagers.</p>

They work closely with other groups, such as the local druids and the town council, to ensure that the needs of the community are met. The villagers trust the Caretakers implicitly and often seek their advice on matters of health and wellness.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Caretakers' Society was founded by Sumil Coralaeth, an elf who came to Luminia over two hundred years ago. She established the guild as a way to share her knowledge of healing with others and ensure that the people of Luminia always had access to skilled practitioners. Over time, the guild has grown and evolved, with new members joining and bringing their own skills to the organization.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> During a particularly harsh winter, the Caretakers braved the snow and ice to tend to the sick and injured. They were able to keep the death toll lower than expected and earned the gratitude of the entire village.. After a young girl was bitten by a poisonous spider, the healers worked tirelessly to create a new poultice that ultimately saved her life.. When a group of bandits attacked Luminia, the Caretakers were on the front lines, tending to the wounded and saving lives.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> A deadly plague sweeps through Luminia, and the Caretakers must race against time to find a cure before it's too late.. The Caretakers discover a new healing method that could revolutionize the way medicine is practiced in the village, but must overcome resistance from traditionalists.. A rival group of healers arrives in Luminia, and the Caretakers must prove their worth and defend their reputation against those who would undermine them.</p>

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> Poor</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The people of Luminia hold the Circle in high regard, and many seek out their services and counsel in times of need. The Circle, in turn, takes an active interest in the well-being of the village, using their magic to protect the land and its inhabitants from threats both natural and supernatural. They maintain friendly relations with the nearby tribe of forest-dwelling elves and maintain cautious diplomacy with the neighboring kingdom, which occasionally seeks to exert control over Luminia and its resources.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Circle has been a fixture of Luminian life for generations. Its founders were a group of powerful women who came together to study and practice magic in secret, fearing persecution from the patriarchal society around them. Over time, the group grew in numbers and influence, and eventually became an integral part of the community.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Legend has it that one of the founding members of the Circle was able to divine the exact location of a hidden chamber containing ancient texts, which led to a great leap forward in their understanding of magic and history. Another member once enchanted an entire hamlet's worth of livestock to help them escape a devastating fire in the middle of the night. And on one memorable occasion, the entire Circle joined forces to break the hold of a powerful curse that had befallen a visiting noblewoman.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> Mysterious thefts of rare magical ingredients. A powerful curse on a member of the Circle. A political crisis requiring the Circle's intervention to maintain Luminia's independence</p>

				<p><b>History:</b> The Cult of the Old One was founded by a small group of scholars and adventurers centuries ago, who stumbled upon a strange artifact that led them to the belief in the Old One.

However, they remain committed to their beliefs and their connection to the unique continent they call home.</p>

The travelers later reported experiencing strange visions and vivid dreams during their stay.. There is a rumor that a member of the cult discovered a hidden chamber in the ruins containing ancient texts that describe a forgotten event that has yet to be fully understood.. Some have claimed to have witnessed members of the cult performing strange rituals in the dead of night, involving fire and blood.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Cult of the Old One has been tasked with preserving the ancient ruins in the forest, but they are being threatened by a group of bandits who are seeking treasure.

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Devout of the Non-Gendered God have a close relationship with the people of Luminia. While they are a separate group, they are respected and valued for their contributions to the village. They provide medicinal herbs and honey to those in need, and offer hospitality to travelers passing through. They also work with the village leadership to maintain the peace and security of the area.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Devout of the Non-Gendered God was founded several decades ago by a group of scholars and adventurers who discovered the forgotten event that had caused the imbalance in nature. They built The Temple as a place of worship and teaching, and over time it has become a hub for spiritual and intellectual pursuits. The group has survived several natural disasters and repelled a bandit invasion, but they continue to face external influences that threaten their way of life.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> One member of The Devout of the Non-Gendered God, Derry Talbot, is renowned throughout Luminia for her knowledge of medicinal herbs. She has been called upon to treat everything from minor injuries to life-threatening illnesses, and has saved countless lives over the years. Another member, Cammy Talbot, once ventured into the ancient ruins on her own to search for a rare plant, but got lost and had to be rescued by her fellow villagers. Finally, the group once held a ceremony to honor the spirits of the forest, and during the ritual they sensed a disturbance in the balance of nature. Upon investigation, they discovered a group of goblin raiders who were poisoning the river and disrupting the ecosystem. Thanks to their intervention, the goblins were defeated and the natural balance was restored.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Devout of the Non-Gendered God have learned of a group of outsiders who are planning to mine iron ore in the nearby mountains. While they appreciate the importance of trade and commerce, they fear that such activities will upset the delicate balance of nature and harm the local ecosystem. The group may seek the aid of the adventurers and scholars in Luminia to prevent the outsiders from carrying out their plans, or they may attempt to negotiate a compromise that allows for economic development while preserving the natural environment.</p>

				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> One of the founding members of The Ember Crafters was said to have discovered the secret to creating high-quality charcoal while meditating in the forest. Another member, a notorious prankster, once filled the village square with smoke by accidentally setting fire to a batch of charcoal during a public demonstration. Yet another member, an eccentric inventor, created a new kind of charcoal oven that revolutionized the industry and helped The Ember Crafters stay ahead of their competition.</p>

It's up to the players to help The Ember Crafters discover the rival guild's secret and put an end to their nefarious activities.

This led to a heated debate that lasted for days, with both sides eventually agreeing to disagree.

				<p><b>History:</b> The Sole Savers has been a respected part of Luminia for generations, with many families relying on them for their footwear needs. Despite facing challenges from cheaper, mass-produced shoes from neighboring kingdoms, the guild has managed to stay afloat due to their commitment to quality.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Once, the Sole Savers managed to create a pair of shoes so comfortable that a local bard declared them to be 'the most comfortable shoes in the land'.

Another time, during a particularly harsh winter, the guild worked around the clock to produce shoes for the villagers who were battling the elements. It was a true testament to their dedication to their craft and their community. In a different anecdote, Durgan Vain managed to make a pair of shoes so fine that they were rumored to have magical properties. Some say that the wearer of these shoes could dance for days without tiring.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Sole Savers are hired by a mysterious traveler to craft a pair of special shoes that will take him to a hidden treasure deep in the mountains.

The guild also maintains friendly relations with the nearby tribe of forest-dwelling elves, trading with them for rare herbs and knowledge of the forest.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Timbermen Guild has been active since the founding of Luminia, providing the village with the timber it needs to thrive.

				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> The Timbermen Guild is known for its tall tales and brave deeds. One member, Shay Langworth, once saved an entire group of lumberjacks from a pack of wolves by luring them away with a song. Another member, Bryson Villius, has been known to fell trees with a single swing of his axe. And yet another member, Kearey Voyle, dreams of becoming a scholar and uses her free time to read and study the ancient texts found in the ruins nearby.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> A massive flood threatens to destroy the Timbermen Guild's logging operation, and they must use all their skills and resources to prevent a disaster.. The guild discovers a rare type of timber that could revolutionize the village's economy, but they must protect it from rival lumberjacks and dangerous creatures..

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Toothed Belt Guild is a respected member of the Luminian community, known for their contributions to the local economy and intellectual pursuits. While they do not interact much with the general population, they have a good relationship with the local scholars and academics, who appreciate their dedication to innovation and problem-solving.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Toothed Belt Guild was founded over a decade ago by a group of like-minded individuals who shared a passion for engineering and automation. Over the years, they have built a reputation as the go-to experts for anything related to toothed belts and machines. While they have faced their fair share of challenges, including government regulations and competition from other guilds, they remain steadfast in their commitment to advancing their craft.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Once, Waldron Ellsworth stayed up for three days straight trying to fix a particularly challenging machine. When he finally succeeded, the entire guild celebrated with honey mead and a parade through the town square.. Harlan Pendrake once designed a machine that could knit an entire sweater in under an hour. It was so efficient that it put several local seamstresses out of business, causing a small controversy in the village.. Bryson Bannister once swore that he would retire from the guild if they were unable to build a machine that could make the perfect batch of cheese. After months of experimenting and tweaking, they finally succeeded, much to Bryson's delight.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Toothed Belt Guild has been hired by a neighboring village to design and build a machine that can harvest their crops more efficiently. However, they soon discover that the real challenge is not in building the machine, but in navigating the politics and power struggles of the village leaders.. The annual toothed belt machine competition is coming up, and tensions are running high as each member of the guild tries to outdo the others. However, when one of the machines unexpectedly malfunctions during the competition, it will take all of their combined skills to figure out what went wrong.. Rumors are spreading that a group of bandits is planning to raid the Toothed Belt Workshop in order to steal their plans for a new machine. The guild must come up with a plan to defend their workshop before it's too late.</p>

The guild also has a good relationship with the nearby tribe of forest-dwelling elves, who often provide them with guidance on navigating the river and avoiding dangerous areas. Occasionally, the Rivermen's Guild has conflicts with nearby kingdoms over disputes related to river access and resources, but they always try to resolve these conflicts peacefully.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> White Rapids Transport was founded by a group of skilled rafters who were looking for a way to make a living while doing what they loved - navigating the rapids of the river. Over time, they became known as the most skilled and dedicated boatmen in the region, and their reputation for reliability and safety grew. Today, the guild is a thriving business that continues to grow and expand.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> One member of the guild, Ruibrarii Coralaeth, once navigated the rapids blindfolded as part of a dare from some visiting adventurers. They made it through without incident, much to the amazement of the onlookers. Another member, Ennis Gilroy, once sang an impromptu song at the inn about the beauty of the river, inspiring many of the listeners to take up rafting themselves. And Enda Voyle, the oldest member of the guild, once managed to navigate the river during a terrible storm, saving a shipment of valuable goods from being lost in the current.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> White Rapids Transport is approached by a wealthy merchant who wants them to transport a valuable cargo downstream to a distant kingdom. However, the journey is fraught with danger, as there are rumors of goblin bands raiding along the river. Will the Rivermen be able to protect the cargo and deliver it safely, or will they fall prey to the goblin threat?</p>

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Woodland Craftsmen have a close relationship with the people of Luminia, providing them with high-quality furniture and cabinetry. They also collaborate with other guilds in the village to create unique pieces that combine different skills and techniques.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Woodland Craftsmen were founded by a group of carpenters who sought to create a community of skilled craftsmen. Over the years, the group has grown in size and reputation, becoming one of the most respected guilds in Luminia.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> One member of the Woodland Craftsmen, Rowe Redgrave, once crafted a table from a tree that he had carved himself. He entered the table into the annual woodworking competition and it won first prize. The table is still on display in the marketplace, and people come from all over to admire it.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Woodland Craftsmen are commissioned by a wealthy noble to create a custom piece of furniture for their castle. The noble is very particular about their taste, and demands that the Woodland Craftsmen adhere to their every whim. However, as the project progresses, the craftsmen discover a dark secret about the noble's past. They must decide whether to remain silent and complete the project, or to reveal the truth and risk losing the commission.</p>

							<p class="npc-anecdote">Godwin once helped a lost traveler find their way back to Luminia, sharing stories and mead with them along the way. The traveler turned out to be a powerful merchant who was so impressed by Godwin's hospitality that he decided to establish a trade route with Luminia, further boosting the village's prosperity.</p>

							<p class="npc-plot-item">One of Godwin's grandchildren, Dara, discovers an ancient text that reveals a dark secret about the non-gendered God of Luminia.

							<p class="npc-plot-item">Godwin learns that the Harvest Guild may have to increase their crop production to meet the demands of a neighboring village.
