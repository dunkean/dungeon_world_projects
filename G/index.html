        <h1 id="_home">Lakemont</h1>
        <p>Concealed within the depths of a mountain forest, a small elven settlement lies hidden from prying eyes. Accessed only by winding paths and secret passages, this ethereal haven emanates an air of enchantment and mystique. Elven dwellings, intricately woven from living vines and adorned with vibrant blossoms, blend seamlessly with the surrounding flora. Soft sunlight filters through the dense canopy, casting dappled patterns upon moss-covered paths. The residents, graceful and attuned to nature, practice ancient elven arts, weaving intricate spells and communing with forest spirits. Echoes of elven songs and laughter drift through the glades, while hidden groves reveal shimmering pools where the moon's reflection reveals ancient prophecies. Silvanvale Refuge stands as a sanctuary of elven wisdom, a place where time seems to slow and the harmony of the natural world thrives undisturbed.</p>

                <h3>anecdotes</h3>
                <p>Lakemont is a village with a rich history of monster attacks. According to the local legends, there was once a legendary monster that terrorized the surrounding countryside, until the ancient settlers managed to slay it in a fierce battle. Although the creature was defeated, its bones can still be seen in the hills overlooking Lakemont. Some say that the monster's spirit still lingers in the area, and that it continues to haunt the villagers from beyond the grave. Others believe that the monster's remains are imbued with magical power, and that they can be used to ward off evil spirits., At night, the calm lake of Lakemont is said to be visited by a ghostly figure that brings good luck to the fishermen. The villagers whisper that this apparition is a manifestation of the Old One, the non-gendered god they worship, and that it blesses those who offer it a gift of fish or other offerings. Some say that the ghostly figure is the spirit of a drowned fisherman who perished in the lake, and who now seeks revenge on the living. Others claim that it is a benevolent water spirit that guides the fishermen to the best fishing spots and protects them from harm. Whatever its true nature, the ghostly figure remains a source of fascination and fear for the villagers of Lakemont., The safety of Lakemont and its people depends on a secret society of hunters who dedicate themselves to keeping the monsters in the mountains at bay. These hunters are selected from among the bravest and most skilled young adults in the village, and they undergo rigorous training in combat and survival skills. They patrol the surrounding forests and mountains, using their knowledge of the terrain and their weapons to track down and eliminate any threat to the village. The hunters are sworn to secrecy about their activities, and their identities are known only to a select few. Their sacrifice and bravery are celebrated annually during the coming-of-age hunt, a rite of passage for young adults in Lakemont., Deep in the mountains surrounding Lakemont, there is said to be a mysterious hermit who possesses great knowledge and power. This reclusive figure is rumored to have lived in the area for centuries, surviving on his wits and his connection to the natural world. Some say that he is a powerful magician or sorcerer, who can control the elements and summon creatures from other realms. Others believe that he is a wise philosopher or prophet, who can see the future and interpret the signs of the universe. The hermit is rarely seen by outsiders, and those who attempt to approach him are met with secrecy or hostility. His true identity and motives remain a mystery to the villagers of Lakemont., Buried somewhere in the village of Lakemont is a cursed object that is said to bring misfortune to those who find it. The origins of this object are shrouded in mystery, and few people know its true nature or location. Some say that it is an artifact of the ancient settlers, imbued with dark magic and buried for safekeeping. Others believe that it is a tool of the Old One, used to punish those who defy its commands. Regardless of its origin, the cursed object is a potent source of fear and superstition for the villagers of Lakemont, who whisper about it in hushed tones and warn their children not to venture too far from home., The people of Lakemont tell of a heroic villager who saved the community from a devastating flood by sacrificing himself to divert the waters. According to the legend, when the river broke its banks and threatened to wash away the village, this brave soul threw himself into the torrent and used his strength to push aside the debris and clear a path for the water to flow. His sacrifice saved countless lives and prevented the destruction of Lakemont. To this day, the villagers honor his memory with a statue in the communal hall, and they retell his story every year during the annual harvest festival.</p>

                <h3>architecture</h3>
                <p>The ancient stone circle on the hill overlooking the village is a site of great significance to the people of Lakemont. It is believed that the circle was erected by the ancient settlers who founded the village, as a way of marking the land as sacred and invoking the blessings of the Old One, their non-gendered god. The circle consists of twelve massive stones, each standing over ten feet tall and weighing several tons. They are arranged in a perfect circle, with a smaller stone in the center that is said to mark the spot where the first offering was made. The villagers gather at the stone circle during important ceremonies such as the equinoxes and solstices, as well as for other special occasions such as weddings or funerals. The stones are also said to have magical properties that can heal the sick, ward off evil spirits, or even grant wishes. The villagers treat the circle with great reverence and ensure that it is carefully maintained and protected from harm., The communal hall in Lakemont is the largest building in the village and serves as a central gathering place for the community. It is used for a variety of events and celebrations, from weddings and funerals to community meetings and festivals. The hall is constructed from local timber and stone and features a large, open interior space that can accommodate several hundred people. At one end of the hall is a raised platform where musicians and performers can entertain the crowd, while at the other end is a large fireplace that provides warmth and light during the cold winter months. The walls of the hall are adorned with colorful tapestries and banners that depict scenes from the village's history and legends. The hall is also home to a collection of artifacts and relics that have been passed down through the generations, including ancient weapons, tools, and household items. Visitors to the hall are greeted by friendly villagers who are always eager to share their customs and traditions with outsiders., The small temple dedicated to the Old One is a humble but deeply revered place of worship for the people of Lakemont. Constructed from local stone and timber, the temple features a simple altar adorned with candles, flowers, and offerings of food and drink. The walls of the temple are decorated with intricate carvings and murals that depict scenes from the village's mythology and history. The temple is tended to by a group of priests and priestesses who are responsible for conducting the rituals and ceremonies that honor the Old One. Visitors to the temple are welcome to observe the rituals and participate in the ceremonies if they wish, but are expected to show respect for the sacred space and the beliefs of the community., The fortified wall and gates that surround the village are a testament to the defensive capabilities of the people of Lakemont. Built to withstand attacks from the monsters that roam the nearby mountains, the wall is constructed from massive stones and reinforced with iron and timber. The gates are flanked by guard towers that are manned around the clock by trained villagers armed with bows, spears, and swords. Visitors to the village must pass through the gates and be subject to a thorough inspection before being allowed to enter. Despite its imposing appearance, the wall and gates blend seamlessly into the natural landscape and do not detract from the village's beauty., The watchtower overlooking the mountain passes is a vital part of Lakemont's defenses against the monsters that threaten the village. Constructed from stone and timber, the tower stands over fifty feet tall and provides a commanding view of the surrounding terrain. The tower is manned by a small group of guards who keep watch day and night for any signs of danger. They use signal flags and horns to communicate with the guards on the wall and gates below, as well as with other nearby communities. The tower also serves as a beacon of hope and reassurance for the villagers, reminding them that they are not alone and that their safety is being diligently guarded., The underground network of tunnels and bunkers that lie beneath Lakemont are a testament to the resourcefulness and ingenuity of the village's founders. Constructed over several decades by skilled craftsmen and engineers, the tunnels and bunkers were designed to shelter the villagers in the event of a catastrophic attack from the monsters or other external threats. The tunnels are wide enough to accommodate carts and livestock, and are well ventilated and illuminated with oil lamps. The bunkers are stocked with food, water, weapons, and medical supplies, as well as maps and other essential equipment. The entrances to the tunnels and bunkers are cleverly hidden in plain sight, integrated into the landscape and buildings of the village so as not to attract attention. Despite their effectiveness as a means of protection, the tunnels and bunkers are seldom used except in emergencies, as the villagers prefer to live openly and freely above ground.</p>

                <h3>customs</h3>
                <p>The annual harvest festival in Lakemont is more than just a celebration of the village's bountiful crops. It's a time for everyone in the community to come together and give thanks for their good fortune. The festival begins with a ceremonial parade through the village, led by the town's leaders and followed by the villagers carrying baskets of fruits and vegetables. At the festival grounds, there are games, competitions, music, and dancing. The highlight of the festival is the feast, where everyone sits down together to share food and stories. The festival lasts for three days, and it's a time of great joy and camaraderie., The offering to the Old One is a solemn and reverent ceremony that takes place four times a year, at the start of each season. The Old One is a non-gendered god that the villagers believe watches over them and protects them from harm. The ceremony takes place in the temple dedicated to the Old One, where the villagers bring offerings of food, flowers, and other items that they believe will please the god. The priestess of the temple conducts the ceremony, which includes prayers, hymns, and the burning of incense. The offering to the Old One is a reminder to the villagers of their connection to the divine, and it helps to reinforce their faith and sense of community., The ritualistic dances around the lake during full moon nights are a tradition that goes back to the earliest days of the village. The villagers believe that the full moon is a time of heightened spiritual energy, and they use the opportunity to perform dances that they believe will bring good fortune and protect them from harm. The dances take place on specially prepared areas around the lake, where the villagers light torches and wear brightly colored clothing. The dances are accompanied by music played on traditional instruments, and they can last for hours. The villagers believe that the energy generated by the dances can ward off evil spirits and help to ensure a bountiful harvest., The coming-of-age hunt through the mountains is a rite of passage for young adults in Lakemont. The hunt takes place once a year, and it's an opportunity for the young people to prove themselves as hunters and warriors. The hunt is a dangerous journey through the rugged mountains surrounding the village, where the young hunters must face dangerous animals and treacherous terrain. The hunt lasts for several days, and it's a test of endurance, courage, and skill. The young people who complete the hunt are celebrated as heroes, and they are recognized as full members of the community., The tradition of storytelling every full moon is a time for the villagers to gather and share their experiences and wisdom with each other. The storytelling takes place in the communal hall, where the villagers sit around a roaring fire and take turns telling stories of their adventures, dreams, and fears. The stories can be funny, sad, or scary, and they often reveal something about the storyteller's character and beliefs. This tradition helps to strengthen the bonds between the villagers and reinforces the importance of community and tradition., The communal bathhouse in Lakemont is not only a place to clean oneself but also a social gathering spot. The bathhouse is open to everyone in the village, and it's a place where people can relax and unwind after a long day of work. The bathhouse is heated by underground hot springs, and the water is believed to have healing properties. People often linger in the bathhouse, chatting with friends and neighbors, sharing news and gossip, and even making business deals. The bathhouse is an integral part of the village's social fabric, and it helps to reinforce the sense of community and belonging among the villagers.</p>

                <h3>external_influences</h3>
                <p>Occasional trade with nearby villages and towns have provided Lakemont with the opportunity to expand their resources and share their rich culture. The village has established trade agreements with neighboring communities, exchanging their agricultural products and unique crafts for goods such as clothing, weapons, and materials that are not found in their region. This has allowed them to strengthen their trading relationships, promote intercultural exchange and attract more visitors who are interested in experiencing their way of life., Occasional visits from traveling merchants and adventurers bring new stories, ideas, and products to Lakemont. These visitors offer a unique perspective on the outside world and their experiences often inspire the villagers to pursue new opportunities or solve pressing issues. Merchants may introduce new technologies, medicines, or exotic foods, while adventurers may share valuable information about local threats and potential allies. However, some outsiders may not share the same values and beliefs as the villagers and can cause tension or conflict, leading to the necessity of careful vetting and management of these visitors., Clashes with rival communities over natural resources have been a recurring issue for Lakemont. Despite their peaceful nature, competition for water, land, and other resources sometimes leads to conflict with other villages and towns in the surrounding area. However, Lakemont's strong defensive position, communal mindset, and an efficient network of watchtowers have allowed them to survive many attempts from rivals to invade or sabotage their village. Diplomatic efforts are often conducted to resolve these conflicts peacefully., Encounters with wandering monsters and bandits pose a constant threat to Lakemont's safety. The mountainous surroundings of the village are inhabited by various creatures that have been known to attack or steal from the villagers. Bandits also pose a danger, as they often seek to take advantage of Lakemont's wealth or isolated location. The villagers have developed a specialized group of hunters and watchmen to patrol the area and protect their community. However, these efforts are not always enough, leading to the necessity of cooperation with neighboring communities, hiring adventurers or seeking help from higher authorities., The occasional intervention of the empire's military forces provides a complex dynamic in Lakemont. As part of a larger empire, the village falls under the jurisdiction of the military forces, who may occasionally exercise their power in the region. While this can provide protection against external threats, it can also lead to a loss of autonomy, tension between local leaders and imperial representatives or even unwanted interference in local customs or beliefs., Relations with nearby religious orders have been a source of inspiration, conflict, and questioning for Lakemont. The village's local beliefs and practices do not directly align with any major religious group, which has led to curiosity and interest from different religious orders. While some villagers may have embraced new religious doctrines or practices, others may have rejected them, leading to tension or conflict within the community. The relationship with these religious orders is often ambivalent, as they may provide aid or support, but also try to impose their beliefs or values.</p>

                <h3>history</h3>
                <p>Lakemont was founded by a group of strangers who sought refuge in this mountainous region from the dangers of the world. They found a calm lake that provided them with freshwater, and fertile farmland to cultivate. They built their homes using the timber from the surrounding forests, and soon established a prosperous community. However, they soon realized that the mountains were also home to many dangerous monsters that threatened their safety. Over the years, the people of Lakemont have successfully repelled several monster attacks, thanks to their defensive wall and gates that surround the village., In one particularly difficult period, Lakemont endured a severe drought that devastated their crops. Many villagers lost their livelihoods, and there was a fear that the entire community would collapse. However, the people of Lakemont came together and shared resources, helping each other through this difficult time. They worked together to find new ways to irrigate their crops and survive the drought. With the determination and resilience of the people of Lakemont, they eventually overcame this challenge and emerged stronger than before., Lakemont flourished during a period of peace and prosperity, thanks to their abundant natural resources and hardworking people. They established their own unique customs, such as an annual harvest festival, offering to the Old One at the start of each season, and ritualistic dances around the lake during full moon nights. They also had a coming-of-age hunt through the mountains for young adults and a tradition of storytelling every full moon. The communal bathhouse was also an important part of their culture, where people gathered to socialize and relax after a long day of work., However, this period of peace and prosperity was not without its challenges. A charismatic leader emerged and challenged the decentralized structure of the village. This led to internal strife, with some villagers supporting the new leader and others fiercely defending the established ways of Lakemont. After much debate and discussion, the villagers came together to find a compromise that would honor both tradition and innovation. They established a council of leaders, where everyone had a say in decision-making, but ultimately, the best interests of the village were the top priority., In addition to internal challenges, Lakemont also faced external threats. Natural disasters such as floods and landslides were common in this mountainous region, and the people had to be ready to respond quickly to protect their homes and loved ones. They also clashed with rival communities over natural resources, sometimes leading to violent confrontations. The wandering monsters and bandits posed a constant threat to their safety, and they had to be ready to defend themselves at all times. In some cases, the empire's military forces intervened to help protect Lakemont from these external threats., Despite all these challenges, the people of Lakemont have always remained proud of their unique cultural identity. They honor the legacy of the ancient settlers who first founded the village, and continue to pass down their customs and traditions from generation to generation. They also value their relationship with neighboring communities, and strive to maintain good relations with them. Lakemont is a place of rich history and culture, where the local beliefs center around the non-gendered god known as the Old One. They believe that this deity protects them from harm, and they offer regular sacrifices to honor and appease the god. They are also proud to be part of a single big nation that shares many of the same cultural values, and a unique continent that is like no other in the world.</p>

                <h3>resources</h3>
                <p>Fertile farmland is one of the most valuable resources in Lakemont. Despite being a small and remote village, its lands are incredibly fertile thanks to the volcanic soil that covers the region. The farmers of Lakemont work hard to cultivate wheat, corn, barley, and other cereal crops, as well as vegetables and fruits such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and apples. They also keep herds of sheep, cows, and pigs that provide them with meat, dairy products, and wool. The village's prosperity largely depends on the quality and quantity of their harvests that they gratefully celebrate every year at the annual harvest festival., The calm lake that surrounds Lakemont is another vital resource for the villagers. The fish swimming in its waters provide a source of sustenance as well as economic exchange. The locals use various methods of fishing, including nets, hooks, and traps, and catch a variety of fish such as trout, carp, perch, and catfish. They know how to preserve fish using salting, smoking, and drying techniques, which allows them to consume fish even during the winter months. The lake also serves as a site for recreational activities such as swimming, boating, and skating. The ritualistic dances around the lake during full moon nights provide not only entertainment but also a moment of reflection for the villagers., The surrounding forests of Lakemont offer an abundance of timber that is used for construction, furniture, and heating purposes. The trees include oak, beech, pine, and spruce, and are carefully managed thanks to the forestry practices of the villagers. They know how to identify the mature trees that can be cut without harming the forest's ecological balance and how to replant new trees to ensure the sustainability of the resource. The forest is also rich in game animals such as deer, rabbits, and wild boars, which provide meat and hides. The hunters of Lakemont are skilled and use bows, crossbows, and spears to catch their prey., The mountains surrounding Lakemont offer an array of herbs and spices that are highly valued by the locals for their medicinal properties as well as their culinary use. The villagers collect herbs such as thyme, sage, and rosemary, and use them to prepare teas and remedies for various conditions such as arthritis, digestive disorders, and colds. They also gather mushrooms and berries that grow in the woods during the autumn months. The mountains are also home to wild game such as mountain goats and bears that the villagers hunt in moderation., Animal pelts and furs from hunting are highly prized by the villagers of Lakemont, especially during the winter months when the temperatures drop dramatically. The hunters are skilled at catching animals such as foxes, wolves, and minks, and use their hides to make fur coats, hats, and gloves. The tannery in the village turns the hides into leather which is used to make shoes, bags, and belts. The villagers also use animal bones to make tools and jewelry, and animal fat to make candles and soap., Local crafts and textiles are a reflection of the unique cultural identity of the villagers of Lakemont. They use the wool from their sheep to make warm and sturdy clothes such as tunics, pants, and skirts. They also weave and dye fabrics using natural materials such as plant fibers and berries.

                <p>The annual harvest festival in Lakemont is a time of great celebration and joy. The villagers come together to celebrate the fruits of their labor and the abundance of the land. The festival takes place in late summer, when the crops have been harvested and stored for the long winter ahead. The festivities begin with a grand feast, featuring local dishes made from the freshest ingredients. There is music, dancing and games for all ages, and everyone is encouraged to join in the fun. This is a time for the whole community to come together and enjoy the bounty of the land., The offering to the Old One at the start of each season is a deeply spiritual and important ceremony for the people of Lakemont. The Old One is a non-gendered god that the villagers believe protects them and guides them through life. At the start of each season, the villagers gather at a small temple dedicated to the Old One. They bring offerings of food, flowers, and other gifts, which they leave at the altar as a sign of respect and gratitude. They then pray for blessings and guidance for the season ahead. This is a time for reflection and renewal, and a chance for the villagers to connect with their faith and with each other., Communal fishing expeditions on the calm lake are a popular pastime in Lakemont. The lake is home to a variety of freshwater fish, and the villagers work together to catch as much as they can. This is a real team effort, with people of all ages and skills coming together to haul in the nets and sort the fish. The catch is shared amongst everyone, ensuring that no one goes hungry. Fishing expeditions are also a chance for the villagers to enjoy the beauty of the lake and to bond over a shared experience., Ritualistic dances around the calm lake during full moon nights are a time for spiritual connection and celebration. The villagers believe that the full moon is a time of great power and magic, when the veil between the worlds is thinnest. They gather at the edge of the lake, where torches light the way. They dance in a circle, moving to the beat of drums and flutes, while chanting prayers to the Old One. This is a time to connect with the divine, to celebrate the beauty of nature, and to honor the ancestors who came before., The yearly hunt through the mountains for young adults is a rite of passage for the youth of Lakemont. This is a test of strength, endurance, and courage, as the young people venture into the wilderness to hunt game. They must work together, using their skills and wits to track and capture their prey. The hunt is also a time for reflection and self-discovery, as the young people face challenges and gain new insights into themselves and their place in the world. Once the hunt is over, there is a grand feast, where the hunters share their spoils and celebrate their achievements., Natural disasters such as floods or landslides are rare in Lakemont, but when they do occur, the villagers pull together to overcome them. They have a long history of facing adversity and coming out stronger on the other side. When a disaster strikes, the villagers work together to assess the damage and to come up with a plan for recovery. They draw on their resources and their community spirit to repair what has been lost and to ensure that everyone is safe and cared for.

In return, the Bancrofts receive support from their neighbors and are respected for their role in the village.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Bancrofts were one of the first families to settle in Lakemont and have been a central part of the community ever since.

However, they have always managed to overcome these obstacles and thrive as a family.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> During one particularly harsh winter, the Bancrofts ran out of firewood. They had to venture outside the village gates to collect enough wood to last them through the season. Despite being attacked by monsters, they managed to return safely with enough firewood to keep their family warm.. Enda Bancroft once decided to challenge her father to a plowing contest. She won the contest, but her father was so proud of her that he gave her his best plow as a gift.. When Morna Bancroft was a child, she used to sneak out to visit a nearby stream. One day, she discovered a rare flower growing by the stream and brought it home. The flower became a symbol of hope for the family and is now grown in a special garden on their farm.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Bancrofts' crops are failing due to a disease afflicting their plants. They must find a cure before winter sets in and their families starve.. A neighboring village is encroaching on the Bancroft's land, claiming that it belongs to them. The Bancrofts must fight to protect their farm and their way of life.. A young member of the Bancroft family has gone missing in the mountains. The family must band together and brave the dangers of the wilderness to find their missing kin.</p>

The brewery is run by Muriel Villius, a creative and imaginative brewer who is always experimenting with new flavors and techniques, and Dermid Finnigan, a hardworking and responsible halfling who takes care of the practical aspects of the business.

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> Barrington Brewery enjoys a close relationship with the rest of the village, as their beers and meads are a favorite among the townsfolk. They also participate in Lakemont's annual harvest festival, selling their wares and sharing their knowledge of brewing with interested visitors.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> Founded by the Barrington family generations ago, the brewery has been a staple of Lakemont ever since. It survived the drought that devastated the village's crops and continues to thrive in times of peace and prosperity. The brewery has also weathered several monster attacks and the infamous flood that threatened to wipe out the village.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Many years ago, Muriel Villius experimented with a rare combination of hops and spices to create a brew that became an instant hit among the locals. It is still one of their most popular drinks.. Dermid Finnigan once had to improvise when a shipment of hops failed to arrive on time. He ended up using some wildflowers he found growing nearby to give the beer its distinct floral flavor.. Katerine Barrington once accidentally spilled a batch of mead on herself, staining her clothes and getting thoroughly drunk. The incident quickly became a legend among the villagers.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Barringtons have been approached by a rival village who wants to buy their secret recipe for their most famous brew. However, some members of the family are hesitant to part with it.. The brewery is running out of storage space for their ingredients and equipment. They need to acquire a new location, but the only available option is haunted.. A wealthy noble from a neighboring land wants to invest in the brewery. However, the Barringtons suspect they may have ulterior motives.</p>

				<p><b>History:</b> The group was formed decades ago by a group of outcasts who sought a new way of life. They realized their potential as thieves and assassins, and began operating in secret.

				<p><b>Plot:</b> A wealthy merchant hires the Shadows of Lakemont for a delicate mission. He wants them to steal a valuable artifact from a rival merchant, but the artifact is protected by magical wards and guards. 
 The Shadows must find a way to bypass the magical protections and get their hands on the artifact.. A new member joins the Shadows of Lakemont. They are eager to prove themselves, but their recklessness puts the entire group at risk. They must learn to work within the group's strict rules if they want to survive..

The Shadows must find out who the traitor is before they are all captured or killed.</p>

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Swords of Lakemont are respected and valued members of the community. They work closely with the village leaders to ensure that everyone is safe and secure. They also maintain positive relationships with neighboring communities, often helping out when they are in need.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Swords of Lakemont were formed after a particularly vicious monster attack nearly destroyed the village. The townspeople realized they needed a dedicated group of defenders if they wanted to survive in this dangerous world, and so the militia was born. Since then, they have successfully repelled numerous attacks and have become an integral part of Lakemont's defense.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> One year, during the annual tournament, a young recruit named Rowe Montfort shocked everyone by defeating the reigning champion and winning the tournament. It was a moment of great pride for the militia, and Rowe went on to become one of their most skilled and respected members. 

One winter, the village was hit by a severe blizzard that left them cut off from the rest of the world. The Swords of Lakemont worked tirelessly to dig out the snow drifts and ensure that everyone had enough food and fuel to survive. They were hailed as heroes by the grateful villagers. 

During a particularly nasty monster attack, Desle Montfort was separated from the rest of the group and found herself facing down a terrifying beast alone. With quick thinking and incredible bravery, she managed to defeat the monster and save the lives of several villagers.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The village is facing a new, unknown threat; it's up to the Swords of Lakemont to investigate and defeat it. An outside force tries to bribe the militia into turning on their own village. The annual tournament is approaching, but this year the contestants start disappearing under mysterious circumstances</p>

They are often called upon to help with various construction or repair projects throughout the village, and they have built strong relationships with other families and tradespeople. The The Builders has also served as a source of wisdom and guidance for other families in Lakemont.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The The Builders has been a part of Lakemont since its founding, and their ancestors were among the original settlers of the village. Over the years, they have played a key role in maintaining and fortifying the village's defensive structures. During a particularly difficult drought, the Builders were able to construct an irrigation system that helped save the village's crops. More recently, they worked tirelessly to rebuild after a devastating flood threatened to wipe out the village.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> One year, a group of bandits tried to steal the Builders' tools and supplies. The family banded together and fought off the attackers, proving that their strength and skill go beyond their work. Another time, during a particularly harsh winter, the Builders constructed a series of warming stations throughout the village to ensure that everyone had a place to stay warm.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Builders learn that a neighboring town is in dire need of repairs after a natural disaster. They must decide whether to use their skills and resources to help out, potentially putting Lakemont at risk if they are away for too long. A new group of young apprentices join the Builders, and the family must balance teaching them while still maintaining their high standards of craftsmanship. An outsider comes to Lakemont and challenges the Builders to a physical competition, testing their strength and unity as a family.</p>

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> 3</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The relationship between The Digging Clan and Lakemont as a whole is generally positive, but occasionally tense. While the villagers of Lakemont rely heavily on the resources extracted by The Digging Clan, there is also a sense of competition and envy between the two groups. Additionally, The Digging Clan's dedication to innovation and progress has sometimes put them at odds with more traditional or conservative factions within Lakemont's leadership.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Digging Clan was founded over a century ago by a group of skilled miners who sought to band together for greater protection and increased access to valuable mining resources. Over the years, they have weathered many challenges, including cave-ins, accidents, and resource scarcity. However, they have remained dedicated to their craft and have emerged as one of the most respected and prosperous groups in Lakemont.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> One member of The Digging Clan, Gade Dunford, is known for his strange habit of talking to the rocks he's mining, asking them politely to give up their treasures. Another member, Vahn Lynch, once singlehandedly fought off a group of bandits who had attempted to steal The Digging Clan's latest haul. Finally, Brill Bancroft is rumored to have discovered a secret underground network of tunnels and passageways that lead directly to the heart of a massive diamond deposit, but he has shared this information with no one.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Digging Clan discovers a vast underground network of tunnels and chambers, filled with riches beyond their wildest dreams. However, they soon discover that they are not alone in these depths, as a tribe of vicious subterranean monsters have also staked their claim. Will The Digging Clan be able to defend their newfound wealth?. Brill Bancroft's discovery of the secret diamond deposit attracts the attention of rival mining groups, who will stop at nothing to claim these riches for themselves. Can The Digging Clan withstand the onslaught?. A catastrophic accident in one of The Digging Clan's mines results in a massive cave-in, trapping dozens of miners underground. Can the remaining members mount a daring rescue before it's too late?</p>

				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The people of Lakemont hold the Ironclad Family in high regard, and they are considered an essential part of the village's economy and defense. Many of the villagers rely on the family's products for their livelihoods, and the town guard often seeks out their services for new equipment. While there have been occasional disagreements between the family and other members of the community, they are generally well-respected and well-liked.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Ironclad Family has a long history in Lakemont, dating back several generations. Originally, they were a small group of blacksmiths who worked together to supply the local farmers and hunters with tools and weapons. As their reputation grew, so did their business, and they began to specialize in crafting armor and weapons for soldiers and adventurers. Despite facing numerous challenges over the years, including monster attacks and economic downturns, the Ironclad Family has persevered and remained a staple of the community.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Legend has it that the very first weapon ever crafted by the founder of the Ironclad Family was so powerful that it could cut through stone with ease. Another story tells of a time when the family forged a suit of armor so strong that it withstood a direct hit from a dragon's fiery breath. Finally, there is the tale of a young apprentice who accidentally dropped a newly-forged sword into the village well, only to have it retrieved several years later by a fisherman who discovered that it had become enchanted during its time in the water.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Ironclad Family has been asked by the town guard to create a new set of armor capable of withstanding a powerful magical attack. A rival blacksmith challenges the family to a forging competition, with the winner getting exclusive rights to supply the town guard with equipment for the next year. The family discovers an ancient mine full of high-quality ore, but it is already inhabited by a group of kobolds who are less than eager to share their resources</p>

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> 5</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The caravan has a good relationship with Lakemont. They provide the village with unique goods in exchange for resources, and they help to protect the area from wandering monsters. However, there have been tensions in the past due to the caravan's occasional run-ins with rival communities over natural resources.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The The Frozen Expedition was founded by a group of Lakemont natives who were fed up with the limited trade options in the village. They decided to take on the challenge of trading exotic goods that were otherwise unavailable in Lakemont. Over the years, they gained recognition for their success in adapting to dangerous routes and their espionage skills. The caravan's reputation grew, and they became more prosperous.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> The caravan once had to cross a frozen river during winter to avoid being caught by bandits. They managed to make it safely across, but not without losing some valuable cargo. 

During an espionage mission, Jenett Bannister posed as a traveling bard and performed at a rival community's celebration, gathering information about their trading routes. She ended up falling in love with a member of the rival community, making the mission much more complicated. 

Morna Denby once successfully convinced an enemy caravan to trade with them instead of attacking, by using her charm and wit.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The caravan is hired to transport a valuable artifact, but they soon find out that they are being followed by a rival group who will stop at nothing to steal it.. The caravan stumbles upon an abandoned mine filled with rare minerals. They must decide whether to keep this discovery secret or share it with Lakemont and potentially face competition from other traders.. A member of the caravan is accused of stealing from a rival community during an espionage mission, putting the entire group at risk.</p>

Their unique customs and beliefs have sometimes caused tension with neighboring communities, but overall the Order is well-respected and admired for its contributions to the wider community.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Order of the Crystal Path was founded over a century ago by a wise and loving figurehead named Ashley Rolfe, who saw a need for a more inclusive and spiritual community in Lakemont.

				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Legend has it that the crystal springs which surround the temple were blessed by the Old One themselves, imbuing the water with magical healing powers.

Lastly, it is said that during a particularly harsh winter many years ago, the members of the Order gathered all the food and supplies they could find and distributed it equally among all the residents of Lakemont, saving many lives in the process.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Order of the Crystal Path is faced with a new challenge when a group of adventurers arrive in Lakemont, each with their own ideas about the nature of the Old One and the proper way to worship them. As tensions rise and conflicting beliefs come to light, the members of the Order must decide whether to stand firm in their traditions or adapt to this new and potentially dangerous situation.</p>

				<p><b>Type:</b> guild</p>
				<p><b>Field:</b> business</p>
				<p><b>Activity:</b> weaving</p>
				<p><b>Description:</b> The Lakemont Weavers are a skilled group of artisans who specialize in creating intricate textiles using wool sourced from the surrounding hills and mountains. They are led by Rosaleen Bainbridge, an experienced master weaver who has taken over the guild from her predecessor. The guild consists of Blayde Darkmantle, a drifter with a checkered past who is looking for a fresh start, and Wolfe Ashburn, a tough and determined hunter who has turned to weaving to supplement his income.</p>

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> 3</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The weavers have a close relationship with the people of Lakemont, who rely on them for warm clothing and other textiles. They are respected for their skill and dedication, and are often called upon to create ceremonial banners and tapestries for important events. They have also established trade relationships with neighboring villages and towns, and are known throughout the region for their high-quality products.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Lakemont Weavers were founded over a century ago by a group of skilled artisans who banded together to share their knowledge and techniques. Over the years, they have faced many challenges, including a devastating fire that destroyed their workshop and a period of decline when the demand for their products waned. However, they persevered and ultimately emerged stronger and more resilient than ever before.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> Rosaleen once wove an intricate tapestry depicting a hunting scene, which was later commissioned by a neighboring lord for his own hunting lodge.. Blayde Darkmantle arrived in Lakemont seeking refuge from a past he would rather forget. Through the guild, he has found a new sense of purpose and belonging.. Wolfe Ashburn's skills as a hunter have proved invaluable to the guild, as he is able to identify the best sources of wool and other natural materials.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The weavers are approached by a wealthy noble who commissions them to create a tapestry depicting his family's crest. However, as they work on the piece, they begin to uncover dark secrets about the noble's past that threaten to destroy their relationship with him.. A rival group of weavers from a neighboring village challenges the Lakemont Weavers to a competition, with the winner earning bragging rights and a prize purse. However, as tensions mount and accusations fly, it becomes clear that there is more at stake than just a friendly competition.. A natural disaster strikes Lakemont, destroying the town's crops and threatening its survival. The weavers must band together with the rest of the community to find a way to rebuild and ensure their future livelihood.</p>

However, they also maintain a degree of independence, and are wary of any outside influence that could threaten their way of life.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Wilderness Keepers can trace their roots back to the earliest settlers of the region, who were known for their survival skills and cunning. Over time, they developed their own distinct culture and customs, centered around their relationship with the land and its creatures.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> During a particularly harsh winter, the Wilderness Keepers managed to survive by catching and trading wild game with nearby villages. This experience strengthened their reputation as skilled hunters and trappers.. When a band of thieves attempted to steal their stores of dried meat and hides, the Wilderness Keepers tracked them down and retrieved their stolen goods.. During a tense dispute over land rights with a neighboring community, the Wilderness Keepers played a key role in negotiating a peaceful resolution.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Wilderness Keepers discover evidence of a monster lurking in the nearby woods, and must track it down before it attacks the village.. A powerful merchant offers the Wilderness Keepers a large sum of money to supply him with rare pelts and exotic game. Will they betray their principles for profit?.
