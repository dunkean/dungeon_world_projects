        <h1 id="_home">The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones</h1>
        <p>Deep within the heart of the formidable mountains lies The Forgotten Enclave, a resilient community eking out an existence within the vast ruins of a once-majestic city. Cut off from the outside world, these settlers and beggars have embraced their precarious existence, fashioning crude shelters amidst crumbling architecture and overgrown foliage. Silent whispers of a lost civilization echo through the labyrinthine streets, while weathered statues and dilapidated structures stand as testament to a grandeur long past. Life in The Forgotten Enclave is a constant struggle for survival, as residents scavenge for meager resources, relying on their resourcefulness and communal bonds to endure within this hauntingly beautiful, forgotten realm.</p>

                <h3>anecdotes</h3>
                <p>The story of the legendary scavenger who discovered a long-lost treasure in the ruins is one that has been passed down through many generations. It is said that this brave adventurer stumbled upon a hidden chamber deep within the ruins of the lost civilization, filled with priceless artifacts and treasures beyond his wildest dreams. The scavenger made off with as much of the loot as he could carry and returned to the enclave a hero, showered with praise and admiration. To this day, the scavenger's exploits continue to inspire young adventurers to set out into the dangerous wilderness in search of their own fortune., The myth of the cursed statue that brings misfortune to those who touch it is one that chills the bones of even the bravest souls in the enclave. Legend has it that a group of scavengers once stumbled upon a strange carved statue deep within the ruins of the lost civilization. They took the statue back to the enclave with them, not realizing the terrible curse that it carried. From that day on, the community was plagued with misfortune and disaster, until finally a wise elder realized the truth and ordered the statue to be cast into the Cursed Well, never to be seen again. To this day, some residents still swear that they can feel the statue's malevolent presence lurking in the shadows, waiting for its next victim., The legend of the Great Flood that destroyed the previous settlement before the current one was founded is a cautionary tale that serves as a reminder of the fragility of life in the enclave. It is said that a terrible storm descended upon the mountain, bringing with it a deluge of rain and wind that battered the settlement and washed away everything in its path. Homes were destroyed, families were torn apart, and many lives were lost. But through sheer tenacity and determination, the survivors managed to rebuild and establish the current settlement, vowing to always be prepared for whatever nature may throw their way., The tale of the lost child who wandered into the wilderness but was saved by a pack of wolves is a heartwarming story that speaks to the resilience and resourcefulness of the residents of the enclave. It is said that a young child once wandered away from the safety of the community and became lost in the dense forest surrounding the mountain. As night fell and the child grew increasingly desperate, a pack of wolves emerged from the darkness and began to circle him. But instead of attacking, the wolves protected the child through the night, keeping him warm and safe until he was finally discovered the next morning. From that day on, the wolves were considered to be sacred protectors of the enclave, and their howls could often be heard echoing through the mountains at night., The rumor of a hidden cult within the community who worship a secret deity is one that has been whispered about in hushed tones for many years. Some say that a group of residents have taken to worshipping a mysterious and unknown deity, conducting secretive rituals and ceremonies in the dead of night. Others claim that the cult is nothing more than a paranoid delusion, fueled by the isolation and precarious existence of the enclave. But despite the rumors, no concrete evidence of the supposed cult has ever been uncovered, leaving many residents to wonder if it truly exists or if it is simply a figment of their collective imagination., The joke about the community's obsession with recycling everything, even old socks and broken crockery is one that highlights the admirable resourcefulness and self-sufficiency of the enclave. In a place where resources are scarce and every item is valuable, the residents have learned to make do with what they have and to salvage and reuse everything possible. They are known throughout the region for their innovative recycling techniques, and visitors are often amazed to see how they can turn even the most mundane objects into useful tools and materials. The joke is a lighthearted way of acknowledging this impressive feat, and it serves as a reminder of the incredible resilience and ingenuity of the residents of the enclave.</p>

                <h3>architecture</h3>
                <p>The Great Hall is a central gathering place for the Enclave of the Forgotten Ones, where residents come together for communal potluck dinners or important meetings. The hall is a simple but spacious wooden structure, with a large hearth at one end where food is cooked and served. Long wooden tables and benches provide seating for everyone, and residents take turns volunteering to prepare and serve meals. Despite the precarious existence of the community, they remain resilient and resourceful, relying on their communal bonds to support each other through difficult times. The atmosphere in the Great Hall is one of warmth and camaraderie, with laughter and conversation filling the air., The Old Temple is a hauntingly beautiful half-ruined structure that serves as a place of pilgrimage for outsiders who come seeking the wisdom of the non-gendered deity worshiped by the Enclave. The temple was originally built by the lost civilization that once thrived in the area, but now its crumbling walls and faded murals speak of a bygone era. Inside the temple, residents come to pray and make offerings to the Old One, seeking guidance and protection in their precarious existence. Visitors who come to the temple are often struck by its eerie beauty and the sense of history and mystery that it embodies., The Cursed Well is a deep well that has long been rumored to bring bad luck to those who drink from it. Despite this reputation, the well is an essential source of fresh water for the Enclave, which has no other reliable source nearby. The well's waters are cold and clear, bubbling up from deep underground. It is said that the curse on the well comes from the lost civilization that once lived in the area, and that the Enclave's founders chose to settle here despite the curse because they had nowhere else to go. Still, many Enclave residents avoid drinking from the well if they can, fearing the curse's power., The High Watchtower is a tall stone structure built on a promontory overlooking the Enclave's territory. The tower is manned day and night by volunteers from the community who keep watch for incoming visitors or enemies. Its height gives a commanding view of the surrounding countryside, and its interior is equipped with telescopes and other instruments to help the watchers identify threats or opportunities. The tower also serves as a warning beacon in times of danger, signaling to other nearby communities that help is needed. Despite its importance, the High Watchtower is a simple structure, with only a few rooms and basic furnishings., The Barracks is a fortified building where residents store weapons and prepare for battle against raiders or slavers who prey on the Enclave's vulnerability. The Barracks is a sturdy stone structure, heavily guarded day and night by residents armed with bows, arrows, and spears. Inside, racks of weapons line the walls, and training dummies and targets fill the open floor space. Volunteers take turns drilling in combat tactics and honing their skills, readying themselves for the next attack. While the Barracks is a somber and serious place, its importance to the community cannot be overstated., The Scrap Yard is an open-air storage area filled with metal scraps salvaged from the ruins of the lost civilization. The yard is a disorganized jumble of discarded metal objects, but to the Enclave residents, each scrap represents a potential tool or weapon. Residents who are skilled at metalworking can often be found here, hammering and shaping bits of scrap into useful objects like knives, arrowheads, and farming implements. Despite being surrounded by decay and ruin, the Scrap Yard is a bright spot in the Enclave, full of industriousness and ingenuity. </p>

Life is precarious in the Enclave, but the residents have learned to rely on one another and their own resourcefulness to survive.</p>

                <h3>customs</h3>
                <p>Memorial Day for Lost Civilization: The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones holds a solemn ceremony every year to remember the lost civilization that once thrived in the area. The community members come together to reflect on the past and pay tribute to those who perished in the ancient ruins. This day serves as a reminder of how precarious their existence is, and how they must remain resilient and resourceful to survive in this hauntingly beautiful but treacherous land. The Enclave's communal bonds are strengthened by this yearly ritual, and their determination to preserve their way of life is reaffirmed., Potluck Dinners: The Enclave's culture revolves around sharing, and one of the most beloved customs is the potluck dinners held on special occasions. Every family contributes a dish to the communal table, and the food is shared equally among everyone present. These gatherings are an opportunity to celebrate their self-sufficient lifestyle and showcase their improvisation skills. They also promote social cohesion as everyone gathers around the table, telling stories and jokes while enjoying the delicious homemade food., Community Watch: The Enclave is isolated, with no contact with the outside world except during rare trading visits. Thus, they have established a community watch system to defend their territory against bandits and raiders. Every member takes turns standing guard at the High Watchtower, scanning the horizon for any signs of danger. The watch duty is taken seriously by all, for they know that their survival depends on it., Ritualistic Scavenging Expeditions: The Enclave's main source of resources is the scrap metal they salvage from the ruins of the lost civilization. To ensure that they have enough supplies to last throughout the year, they organize annual scavenging expeditions. These are highly ritualistic events, with a chosen few venturing into the ruins under the guidance of the community's spiritual leaders. The scavengers believe that the spirits of the lost civilization watch over them in these expeditions, guiding them to the most valuable scraps. The Enclave's survival depends on their ability to scavenge efficiently, so these expeditions are taken very seriously., Daily Communal Prayer to the Old One: The Enclave is a religious community, with a unique local belief system centered around a non-gendered deity known as the Old One. Every day, the community members gather in the Great Hall for communal prayer and reflection. They give thanks to the Old One for providing them with food, water, shelter, and protection. The daily prayer is a reminder of the Enclave's humble origins as refugees seeking safety, and their deep gratitude for their communal bonds and shared resources., Trading with Outsiders During Rare Visits: Although the Enclave is self-sufficient, they do trade with outsiders during rare visits from nearby trading posts. These trading expeditions are highly organized, with a designated team responsible for negotiating with the traders and deciding which resources to acquire. The Enclave's culture of recycling and hoarding makes them shrewd negotiators, and they always seek to obtain the best possible deals. The trading visits are also an opportunity for the Enclave to showcase their practical skills and unique culture to outsiders.</p>

                <h3>external_influences</h3>
                <p>The occasional traders from nearby small communities or the empire bring valuable goods that the enclave cannot produce themselves. These traders often travel to the enclave during the harvest festival to barter for fur and leather goods or wild berries, mushrooms, and herbs. The traders also bring news of other nearby communities, which helps the enclave stay informed about threats and opportunities. However, the enclave's self-sufficiency means they do not rely on these traders too much. They see them as potential allies rather than saviors. The traders sometimes also share stories of their own adventures and experiences with the people of the enclave, widening their worldview and giving them new ideas for future projects. It is important for the enclave to maintain these relations with the traders to keep their access to external resources., Infrequent visits from travelers seeking shelter have become a common occurrence in the Enclave of the Forgotten Ones. The community allows travelers to take temporary refuge, which allows the enclave members to learn about the outside world and its customs. Sometimes, the travelers turn out to be traders, who bring news from other parts of the continent. The enclave members often try to persuade the travelers to settle in their community, but most of them prefer to move on. The travelers who stay longer may be invited to work with the people of the enclave or to participate in their daily rituals and traditions. The people of the enclave are careful when accepting outsiders into their community, but their hospitality has earned them a good reputation among travelers., Bandits and slavers pose a serious threat to the enclave and their isolation makes them vulnerable to attacks. The people of the enclave have established a watchtower at the entrance of their village to watch the roads leading to the enclave. When raiders approach, they activate defensive strategies involving barricading themselves indoors, preparing weapons, and sending scouts to spy on the enemy's movements. They also have an alarm system that alerts the entire community of an incoming attack. When bandits or slavers manage to enter the enclave, they are met with fierce resistance from the well-armed and determined residents. However, these raids have also led to collective trauma among the people of the enclave, and some residents suffer from PTSD as a result of surviving such attacks. The Enclave is constantly on guard against these threats, and it is a testament to their resilience that they have managed to survive for so long despite the odds against them.</p>

                <h3>history</h3>
                <p>The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones was founded by a group of refugees who fled from a war-torn nation seeking safety more than a generation ago. The group found themselves in the harsh mountain environment, and initially struggled to establish a sustainable lifestyle. The founders had no idea what lie ahead, but they were determined to survive and thrive, whatever the cost may be. They had to start from scratch, and this was incredibly difficult. Hunting and gathering was a challenge, as was finding reliable sources of water. Over time, they learned how to use what was available in their environment to their advantage. They started patterning with each other and learning to share whatever resources they had. This is how the foundation of the community was built. , After a few years of surviving and growing, the people of The Enclave discovered the ruins of a lost civilization that they decided to repurpose for their own use. This was a game-changer for the community. They were able to use the scraps of metal and other materials they found in the ruins to build more permanent structures and to create more efficient tools. It was this resourcefulness that allowed them to start developing the communal lifestyle that they still enjoy today. Unfortunately, some of the scavengers who ventured too deep into the ruins never came back – it was rumored that the ruins were haunted by the ghosts of the lost civilization, and this lent an air of haunting beauty to the place that could never be shaken., The Enclave has had its fair share of challenges. At one point in time, a despotic leader tried to impose his will on the community. He believed in a rigid hierarchy with himself at the top. This didn't sit well with the free-spirited people of the enclave. Ultimately, he was removed from power and the people returned to their communal way of life. They had seen the dangers of centralized power and didn't want to see their community destroyed by it. They knew the dangers of depending on a single leader too heavily, and they were determined not to fall into that trap again., Bandits and slavers have long been a problem for The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones. The isolation and vulnerability of the community made them an easy target for these ruthless raiders. The people of the enclave learned to defend themselves over time, but they never got used to the constant fear of attack. It was always in the back of their minds, a reminder of the precarious existence that they had chosen when they decided to live apart from the rest of the world., In addition to fighting off bandits and slavers, The Enclave has had to deal with natural disasters as well. One such disaster was a devastating flood that destroyed half of the community's shelters. Those who survived were forced to start from scratch once again. For months afterwards, the community struggled to rebuild, but they did so with their usual resilience and resourcefulness. As a result, they developed new communal bonds, and their society became even more tightly-knit than before., Despite the challenges faced by The Enclave, they have continued to thrive. Over the years, they have become known for their unique customs and beliefs. They believe in a single god, a non-gendered deity that watches over them. They also don't allow any undead within their community, believing them to be a threat to the living. Their belief system is relatively isolated from the rest of the world. However, they do have contact with other small communities and traders from the bigger empire. This has allowed them to establish a trading route, which has helped them to maintain their self-sufficient lifestyle. They continue to seek out the secrets of the lost civilization and are always on the lookout for new resources to help them survive., The people of The Enclave have faced many challenges and difficulties in their time. But they have always remained resilient and resourceful, using their communal bonds to overcome the harshest obstacles. They know that their precarious existence is not ideal, but they wouldn't trade it for anything. They are proud of who they are, and they will do whatever it takes to defend themselves, their traditions, and their way of life.</p>

                <h3>resources</h3>
                <p>The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones relies heavily on scrap metal obtained from the ruins of the lost civilization to create basic tools and equipment. The ruins, once an advanced and powerful civilization, have been stripped clean by scavengers long ago. However, the community has managed to scavenge enough metal scraps to keep their basic tools functioning. The scraps are melted down in a small furnace and cast into simple shapes. The constant need for repairs and maintenance means that the community has developed a high level of skill in creating and repairing metal tools., The community forages for wild berries, mushrooms, and herbs in the surrounding area. Fruits and vegetables are scarce in the harsh mountain environment, so the people rely heavily on these wild foods for sustenance. They have learned to identify the edible plants and avoid the poisonous ones. Gathering these foods is a communal activity, and the harvest is shared among all members of the community. The abundance of these foods varies depending on the season, and the people must be strategic in their harvesting to ensure that they have enough to last through the winter months., The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones has a freshwater spring that provides drinking water for the entire community. The water is clean and pure, safe for consumption without any treatment. The importance of this spring cannot be overstated, as water is scarce in the surrounding area. The community has taken steps to protect the spring and ensure that it remains clean and accessible. The water is also used for cooking and bathing, and the community is careful not to waste a single drop., The people of the Enclave of the Forgotten Ones hunt and trap local animals to obtain fur and leather, which are used to create warm clothing, blankets, and footwear. These resources are vital for survival during the harsh winter months, when temperatures can dip well below freezing. Hunting and trapping are communal activities, and the people make use of every part of the animal they catch. The community has also learned the art of tanning and curing hides to make them more durable and long-lasting., The people of the Enclave of the Forgotten Ones share tools and equipment, which is critical given the scarcity of resources. Tools and equipment are carefully maintained and repaired to ensure their longevity. Every member of the community is expected to contribute to this communal effort, and those who do not are seen as selfish and uncooperative. The community has developed a strong sense of trust and cooperation, which is essential for their survival in this isolated and precarious environment., The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones relies on crude shelters made of wood and stone to protect themselves from the elements. These shelters are constructed from the materials available in the surrounding area and are designed to be simple and functional rather than aesthetically pleasing. The people do their best to keep these shelters in good repair, but they are vulnerable to damage from harsh weather conditions. As a result, the community has developed a strategy of building multiple shelters in different locations to ensure that they always have a place to go in case of a disaster., The people of the Enclave of the Forgotten Ones make their own clothing and blankets from the materials available in the surrounding area. They use fur and leather obtained from local animals and use weaving and sewing techniques to create warm and durable clothing. The clothing is plain and utilitarian, but it serves its purpose well. Each member of the community is responsible for making their own clothing, but communal efforts are also made to create blankets and other items that are shared among the entire community., The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones engages in bartering with nearby trading posts when they have a surplus of resources. They trade scrap metal, furs, and dried herbs for goods such as salt, spices, and luxury items like fabric or jewelry. Trading is infrequent and must be carefully planned to ensure that the people get the best possible deals. Given the isolation of the community, the traders are always quick to take advantage of any opportunity to make a profit, and the people must be vigilant to ensure that they do not get ripped off.</p>

                <h3>timeline</h3>
                <p>Every year, the members of The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones embark on a scavenging expedition to the ruins of the lost civilization. This expedition is one of the most significant events of the year, as it provides the community with metal scraps and other resources that are hard to come by in their isolated mountain location. The expedition is perilous, as the ruins are dangerous and unpredictable, and bandits and wild animals pose a constant threat. However, the community is resilient and resourceful, and they always manage to return with enough supplies to last them through the harsh winter months., The harvest festival is one of the few times of the year when the community comes together to celebrate their self-sufficient way of life. The festival is held in the Great Hall, where members share potluck meals made with the fruits of their labor. Everyone contributes to the feast, whether it be wild berries, mushrooms, or herbs gathered from the surrounding forest, or vegetables grown in the communal gardens. The festival is also a time for reflection, as members remember those who have been lost and give thanks for the bounty that has been bestowed upon them., The community of The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones follows a unique tradition of communal prayer during major celestial events. During these times, all members of the community gather at the Old Temple to sing hymns and offer prayers to the Old One, their non-gendered deity. These events take place during solstices, equinoxes, and other significant celestial events, and serve as a reminder of their communal bonds and shared beliefs., A new group of refugees seeking safety has emerged on the outskirts of the community. These newcomers are weary and frightened, having fled from a nearby village that has fallen victim to bandit raids. The members of The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones welcome them with open arms, sharing what little they have and offering them shelter from the raiders. The community knows all too well the perils of living in isolation, and they are determined to help these newcomers settle in and establish a new life in their midst., The death of a beloved leader has rocked the community of The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones. The leader, a wise and respected elder, had been instrumental in helping the community survive and thrive in their precarious existence. His passing has left a void in the hearts of all who knew him. In the aftermath of his death, the community must come together to elect a new leader and continue the work that he helped start., The community of The Enclave of the Forgotten Ones is reeling from a devastating slaver raid. The raiders came in the dead of night, taking many of the community's young people and leaving destruction and despair in their wake. The community is now faced with the daunting task of rebuilding, both physically and emotionally. They must also come up with a plan for defending themselves against future attacks, lest they fall victim to the raiders once again.</p>

				<p><b>Prosperity:</b> 1</p>
				<p><b>Relationship:</b> The Rusty Raiders have a close relationship with the rest of the Enclave, who rely on them for valuable resources and trade. The Enclave provides shelter and protection for the Raiders, and they work together closely to maintain their self-sufficient lifestyle.</p>
				<p><b>History:</b> The Rusty Raiders were founded shortly after the Enclave was established, by a group of young adventurers who sought to explore the ruins of the lost civilization. Over time, they became skilled scavengers and began to play a vital role in the Enclave's survival. Despite facing many challenges and setbacks, they have remained a close-knit community of scavengers.</p>
				<p><b>Anecdotes:</b> 1) Once, the Rusty Raiders discovered a cache of ancient artifacts deep within the ruins. They worked together to extract the valuable resources, but in doing so they attracted the attention of a group of raiders who sought to steal their find. The Raiders defended themselves bravely and drove off the attackers, but not before suffering significant losses. 2) During one particularly harsh winter, the Rusty Raiders were forced to ration their supplies of food and water. It was a difficult time, but they pulled together and managed to survive until spring arrived. 3) When a group of traders arrived at the Enclave, the Rusty Raiders were instrumental in negotiating a fair trade deal that benefited both parties.</p>
				<p><b>Plot:</b> The Rusty Raiders discover a valuable resource deep within the ruins of the lost civilization. However, they soon learn that they are not the only ones interested in this resource, and must defend themselves against raiders and slavers who seek to take it by force.. A new threat arrives at the Enclave in the form of a deadly illness that begins to spread among the community. The Rusty Raiders are tasked with finding a cure, but their search takes them deep into uncharted territory and exposes them to dangers they never could have imagined.. The Rusty Raiders must journey to a nearby trading post in order to acquire a vital resource for the Enclave. However, the journey is fraught with danger, and they must use all of their skill and resourcefulness to make it there and back alive.. A group of outsiders arrives at the Enclave, and the Rusty Raiders are tasked with showing them around and teaching them about the way of life in the community. However, the outsiders have their own agenda, and the Raiders soon discover that they may be in more danger than they realized.</p>

Many residents of the enclave rely on them for their livelihood, as the tools and equipment they produce are essential for survival in the harsh mountain environment. In turn, the Tolberts rely on the community to provide them with the resources they need to continue their craft.</p>

However, after his wife fell ill, he decided to stay in the enclave and help run the family business. Although he sometimes wonders what might have been, he knows that his duty to his family is more important than his personal ambitions.
3. Muriel once crafted a sword with such exceptional beauty and grace that it brought tears to the eyes of all who saw it. It is said that the blade was imbued with magic, and that it could cut through steel as if it were paper. The sword has since been lost to time, but its legend lives on.</p>
